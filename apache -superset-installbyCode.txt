Installing and Initializing Superset
First, start by installing apache-superset:

pip install apache-superset

Then, you need to initialize the database:

superset db upgrade





Finish installing by running through the following commands:

# Create an admin user in your metadata database (use `admin` as username to be able to load the examples)
export FLASK_APP=superset
superset fab create-admin

# Load some data to play with
superset load_examples

# Create default roles and permissions
superset init

# Build javascript assets
cd superset-frontend
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..

# To start a development web server on port 8088, use -p to bind to another port
superset run -p 8088 --with-threads --reload --debugger
